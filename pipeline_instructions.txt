1. Log in to phylocluster. Change into /share/WilkeLab/AG3C/data/experiments/ directory. Change into the directory for the desired time course. Copy the data structure in that directory using this function:

tar -cvf hydra_data_structure.tar sample*/RNA/

tar function combines multiple files and directories into a single file

2. Log in to @lonestar.tacc.utexas.edu. Change into scratch and make a "data" directory. Change into "data" and make a folder for a given time course (ex:glucose). Copy the data structure file from hydra to that directory:

cd $SCRATCH
mkdir data
cd data
mkdir glucose_time_course
cd glucose_time_course
scp username@phylocluster.ccbb.utexas.edu:/share/WilkeLab/AG3C/data/experiments/*_time_course/hydra_data_structure.tar .

3. Once you copied the tar file into that directory, unfold the tar file using:

tar -xvf hydra_data_structure.tar

4. You should now have the exact same data structure in $SCRATCH/data/*_time_course/ as in the /share/WilkeLab/AG3C/data/experiments/*_time_course. Make a folder unanalyzed_raw_reads in the same directory to store unanalyzed raw reads pertaining to that time course. Copy all of the reads into that directory. 

5. Change into Ecoli_RNAseq/src/. Run this shell script to make sample*/RNA/*depleted.raw and move the raw reads there (change TIME_COURSE_DIR variable in move_raw_reads.sh to match the time course directory your data is in) by typing:

./move_raw_reads.sh

6. Concatenate reads, if multiple fastq files are present for one sample's each read. Run this function in the same directory (Ecoli_RNAseq/src/) to write a paramlist file that will concatenate all the reads: 

./write_paramlist_concatenate.sh

7. Change into $SCRATCH/data/ and run the concatenation:

chmod +x paramlist_concatenate
./paramlist_concatenate

This will take about 20 mins. The concatenated reads would appear in $SCRATCH/*_time_course/sample*/RNA/*depleted.processed/

7. Now you can make a paramlist file to run the bowtie pipeline in parallel for each sample. Change into Ecoli_RNAseq/src/ and run this function (change TIME_COURSE_DIR variable in write_paramlist_bowtie.sh to match the time course directory your data is in):

./write_paramlist_bowtie.sh

8. Change into Ecoli_RNAseq/job_submissions_files/. Correct the line in bowtie_launcher.sge that says "setenv CONTROL_FILE   paramlist_bowtie_*". "paramlist_bowtie_*" is the file that was written by running ./write_paramlist_bowtie.sh. "*" here stands for the time course you are analyzing.  

9. Now you are ready to submit the job to TACC. Change into $SCRATCH/data/ and run:

qsub $HOME/Ecoli_RNAseq/job_submissions_files/bowtie_launcher.sge 

You can check the status of your job by entering "qstat" function. All of the files generated by the pipeline will appear in SCRATCH/*_time_course/sample*/RNA/*depleted.processed/. 

10. Once the pipeline is done running, you need to combine all the quality control files into one file. Change into the *_time_course (ex: glucose_time_course) and run:

cat sample*/RNA/*depleted.processed/*_quality_control.txt > quality_control_glucose.csv 

Open this file in excel and delete every other line that contains headers from each sample (cat function adds all of the lines in each sample).
